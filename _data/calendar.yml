      Rest in Power, Sly Stone! There will never be another like you. Fitting
      that there is indeed a riot goin on. [Robert
      Christgau's](https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3192) album
      review: 


      Despairing, courageous, and very hard to take, this is one of those rare albums whose whole actually does exceed the sum of its parts. Bleak yet sentient songs of experience like "Runnin' Away" and "Family Affair" lend emotional and aesthetic life to the music's dead spaces; bracing alterations of vocal register, garish stereo separations, growls and shrieks and murmurs, all the stuff that made Sly's greatest hits the toughest commercial experiments in rock and roll history, are dragged over nerve-wracking rhythms of enormous musical energy. The inspiration may be Sly's discovery that the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow doesn't mean shit, but what's expressed is the bitterest ghetto pessimism. Inspirational Verse: "TIME they say is/The answer/But I don't believe it." Original title: *Africa Talks to You*. Length of title track: 0:00. **A+**

    text: "\"Won't you cover me with your pretty lies? Bury my heart at Wounded
      Knee...\" On December 29, 1890 the US Army committed a mass shooting
      murder of Lakota people a part of its lengthy campaign to \"civilize\" the
      frontier. What makes the Wounded Knee Massacre exceptional within American
      history is the speed and violence of the massacre; some reports indicate
      that the Army officers lost control of their men armed with early machine
      guns, who fanned out and methodically murdered the wounded women and
      children. The Wounded Knee Massacre returned to public consciousness after
      the publication in 1970 of a book titled \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee:
      An Indian History of the American West\" by Dee Brown, who borrowed the
      book's title from the 1927 poem \"American Names\" by Stephen Vincent
      Benét: \"I shall not be there. I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at
      Wounded Knee\"."

      originally written in 1936, [remembers labor activist and author Joe
      Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hill_\\(activist\\)). Hill was a
      major figure in early 20th century labor, particularly with his
      organization Industrial Workers of the World (IWW / Wobblies) who coined
      the phrase \"pie in the sky\". In 1914 he was framed for the murder of
      former cop and grocer along with his son, which led to the arrest and
      ultimate execution of Joe Hill on November 19, 1915. \"Aftermath\" from
      Wikipedia: Hill's body was sent to Chicago, where it was cremated; in
      accordance with his wishes, his ashes were placed into 600 small envelopes
      and sent around the world to be released to the winds. Delegates attending
      the Tenth Convention of the IWW in Chicago received envelopes November 19,
      1916, one year to the day of Hill's execution (and not on May Day 1916 as
      Wobbly lore claims).The rest of the 600 envelopes were sent to IWW locals,
      Wobblies and sympathizers around the world on January 3, 1917. In 1988 a
      final envelope of Hill's remains were discovered as seized by the US
      Postal Service and ultimately returned to the Wobblies who read his final
      will and released his ashes into a bonfire in Southeastern Michigan in
      November 1990."

      frontman Joe Strummer and bassist Paul Simonon's participation in the
      [1976 Notting Hill
      Carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notting_Hill_Carnival) riots. The
      annual event was established in the late 1950s, partially due to poor race
      relations, and its 1976 edition saw predominantly Caribbean Londoners in
      conflict with constabulary forces and their harassment of non-white city
      residents. Strummer defended the lyrics, which were misinterpreted as
      pro-white, when Strummer intended the lyrics as a call to arms for white
      to join black solidarity efforts in against class struggle and police
      brutality."

      Chicano Movement was well underway for several years by August 1970 when
      LA County Sheriff's deployed tear gas in Laguna Park to disperse a protest
      against the Vietnam War and the disproportionate loss of Mexican-American
      draftees. Ruben Salazar was the KMEX news director and columnist for the
      Los Angeles Times who covered the demonstration before retreating to a
      Whittier Boulevard bar called the Silver Spoon. LA Sheriffs fired tear gas
      projectiles into the bar, one of which struck Salazar fatally in the head.
