    text: "\"April 26th, 1992, There was a riot on the streets. Tell me where were
      you?\" Fun fact from YouTube: The official title of the song references
      the date April 29, 1992; however, the lyric was sang as \"April 26,
      1992.\" It has been said this was a mistake, but the take was strong
      enough the band kept it. To all those that are skeptical about this, just

      ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots)erupted in South LA
      following the acquittal of four police officers for the beating of Rodney
      King. When the dust settled six days later 62 were dead and over 12,000
