  In the last decade of my career, I’ve shaped stories featured in outlets like
  the Los Angeles Times, WNYC, and WHYY, and supported press outreach and
  response for the environment, arts, politics, and music while bridging
  traditional to new media. I have had a lifelong exposure to newsrooms, as the
  son of a journalist. I enjoy assisting journalists and newsmakers in their
  storytelling and hope you enjoy the sample items below.

      “Everyone has something creative inside them, so I invite everyone to step
      into your own creative practices, voice, visual arts and more, and share
      that with the city."
  - quote: “The Atlantic City Arts Foundation exists to elevate arts and the city —
      public arts, programming, support for artists, youth engagement, turn the
      attention of people who live in/visit AC towards the arts — and provide
      opportunities for artists in the city, county, to exhibit. It also
      attracts major artists to continue to exhibit here,” said Atkins, 36, a
      resident of the Chelsea neighborhood.

    date: October 2023
    quote: Michael Atkins thinks he was a bat in a past life. In fact, he said,
      human beings have more in common with nature’s only flying mammals than
      they realize. Atkins—nonprofit communications director by day, bat
      enthusiast by night—believes learning about the mysterious nightflyers
      opens Philadelphians up to better understanding their urban ecosystem, and
      themselves. He led a free bat walk in FDR Park on Saturday, Oct. 28.

    quote: “Whether it be a weed growing through the concrete or a bat surviving
      under the freeway, these are really effective champions to make sure that
      everyone has a local tie-in to these environmental challenges that we’re
      facing and not just picture an emaciated polar bear or something that’s
      15,000 miles away,” said Michael Atkins.
  - outlet: LA Times
    headline: A deadly fungus is killing millions of bats in the U.S. Now it’s in
      California
    link: https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-white-nose-fungus-kills-california-bats-20190705-story.html
    date: July 2019
    quote: But the discovery of the fungus has suddenly added a sense of foreboding
      to summer evening “Bats and Brews on the River” strolls along a stretch of
      the Los Angeles River north of downtown. The public events sponsored by
      the nonprofit Friends of the Los Angeles River aim to introduce
      participants to the rhythms of bat life in the vicinity of their own
      backyards. “Our goal is to excite and inspire people about the remarkable
      creatures that share the air space over our urban ecosystem every night,”
      said Michael Atkins, a spokesman for FoLAR. “The sadness would be to have
      to say 10 years from now, bats used to be everywhere.”
  - outlet: LA Times
    headline: Fishing the L.A. River is more than a quarantine hobby. For some, it’s
      therapy
    link: https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-04/la-river-fishing-safe-respite-covid-19
    date: August 2020
    quote: Not a single person interviewed said they would eat a fish out of the
      river, except Michael Atkins, communications and impact manager with the
      nonprofit Friends of the L.A. River. “I’m interested to try it, under the
      right circumstance, but I don’t think anyone would officially advise it,”
      Atkins said. Most people queried said they catch-and-release or offer the
      fish to those who live in nearby homeless encampments.
