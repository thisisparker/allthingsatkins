I love to explore the built and natural environments, and love connecting people to their local ecosystem.

bio: >-
  In my professional life I’ve worked for television and film productions and
  nonprofits. I currently serve as the Executive Director of the [Atlantic City
  Arts Foundation](https://atlanticcityartsfoundation.org/) promoting public
  arts in America's playground. I've served as Communications Director for [New
  Jersey Future](<>), a statewide policy nonprofit that advances placemaking and
  urbanism throughout the Garden State, and [Friends of the Los Angeles
  River](https://folar.org/), which organizes the largest urban river cleanup in
  the nation, and advocates for equitable access and a rewilded river in the
  heart of Los Angeles. 


  I've interviewed a wide range of interesting subjects including: authors, artists, architects, active military personnel, congresspersons, historians, and indigenous tribal leaders along the way. I’ve worked political campaigns for local, state, and federal office, and volunteered for public interest endeavors, including the [Baseball Reliquary](https://baseballreliquary.org/) and [Cape May Bird Observatory](https://njaudubon.org/centers/cape-may-bird-observatory/) with elected board positions with [KPFK Los Angeles](https://www.kpfk.org/) and the [East Hollywood Neighborhood Council](https://www.easthollywood.net/). 


  I live in Atlantic City, NJ where my hobbies include bat detecting, bar hopping, and betting on the Birds. Contact me at [michael@allthingsatkins.com](mailto:michael@allthingsatkins.com).
