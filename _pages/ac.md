## Breakfast & Coffee

### Hot Bagels & More ($), 212 Pacific Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

Shore chain of fresh bagels and affordable breakfast. Excellent bagels, breakfast sandwiches, wraps and more. AC location is in the shadow of the Absecon Lighthouse on the north end of the island, which is a great morning stroll in nice weather. Two additional locations on the island, both in Margate, one nicknamed "Ventnor". 

#### Hayday Coffee ($), 155 S New York Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

Third wave coffee shop in the Orange Loop. Hip spot for people who need espresso in AC, great before heading to a convention. Small shop, unassuming, and great for the early birds who fancy a nice coffee and boardwalk or beach stroll. They also introduced some light lunch faire, which scratches an itch when caffeinated. 

### Remedee Coffee ($), 118 S Bartram Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

Summer time and irregular offseason option, this sister duo is doin’ it to it! Remedee runs out of a garage on Bartram weekend mornings where a number of iced and hot beverages are on offer, plus freshly roasted beans. Worth supporting this new business and getting friendly with the proprietors. 

### Gilchrist Restaurant (multiple locations)

Breakfast and lunch staple serving pancakes, egg platters, and sandwiches. A favorite among locals, especially for early lunch or late breakfast parties. Location in Gardner’s Basin offers a charming bayside view in the "good hood", the Tropicana location reminds me oddly of Mel's Drive-In diners in Los Angeles. 

## Lunch

### Barbera’s Seafood ($), 2243 Arctic Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

Inexpensive and high quality fish sandwiches (order two if you have an appetite!), along with fresh fish, and a small market featuring canned fish and other spices for your fish boil. Established in 1919, this unassuming spot boasts AC memorabilia from AC through its century of operation. Counter service, with sparing seats inside. Their motto: “The seafood you eat today slept last night in the Chesapeake Bay.” Very close to the AC Convention Center / train station and outlets. 

### White House Subs ($$), 2301 Arctic Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

Celebrated stacked sub since 1946 with informal counter service (also has a hot grill, not just cold subs, fan of their cheesesteaks). This is a common stop for folks on their way out of town to grab a dry hoagie (oil & vinegar on the side), and bring home to feed yourself and others. Very close to the AC Convention Center / train station and outlets. 

## Dinner

### Knife & Fork ($$$) & Dock's Oyster House ($$$)

Two of the city's classiest fine dining experiences in operation since 1912 and 1897 respectively, now owned by the same family. The K&F is surprisingly welcoming and neighborly, and the bartenders are both are truly the best in the city, willing to whip up a Paper Plane or an original concoction featuring Cynar upon your friend's request. Food is excellent as well; where Dock's features sea creatures, Knife & Fork has fantastic lamb and potatoes au gratin.  

### Tony’s Baltimore Bar and Grill ($-$$), 2800 Atlantic Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

Trendy, late-night, Italian comfort food in an old-school restaurant established in 1927 that still has jukeboxes in their bar booths (they don’t function, but the functional jukebox frequently pipes out old-school soul and doo-wop). Servers are all incredibly colorful, and the bar is a central node for locals who live in and love AC. A favorite of Anthony Bourdain’s, he visited and claimed: “Tony’s Baltimore Grill is a taste of my childhood.” Be sure to get the meatball, also for the adventurous the Clams Casino pizza is a specialty not found elsewhere. Kitchen closes at 3am. 

### Angelo’s Fairmount Tavern ($$), 2300 Fairmount Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

Old-school Italian restaurant since 1935, this is your middle of the road classic restaurant with generous servings – great for dinner with a date, business associates, or family. Located in the Ducktown section of AC, easy access to Convention Center, AC Expressway, and mid-beach casinos. Entrees run $17-28, with other more expensive options, for the so inclined. 

### Kelsey’s and/or Kelsey and Kim’s ($$), multiple locations

Operated by a local husband and wife team, these restaurants have restored a long and storied tradition of soul food and Black culture in Atlantic City. Kelsey and Kim’s location is on the north side of town and open nightly, Kelsey’s on Kentucky Ave has reopened in what was once a vibrant Black section of town known to host the best performers over various eras of music and entertainment. Classic and classy soul food – fried chicken, waffles, collared greens, BBQ pork and beef. 

### Pho Sydney ($), 2323 Atlantic Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

High quality, inexpensive, authentic Vietnamese food in an unadorned restaurant in the heart of AC. Pho and spring rolls are highly recommended, food comes out hot and quick. If you're lucky you can catch the second half of and NFL playoff game and keep time with the crew. Within blocks of Caesar’s. 

Honorable Mentions: Hell’s Kitchen, but not the Wellington ($$$), Setaara, although they require a deposit on reservations ($$$), Yardy’s Real Jamaican Food ($$), Chart House Seafood ($$$), Chef Vola’s ($$$)

# ATTRACTIONS

### Absecon Lighthouse ($), 31 S Rhode Island Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

State’s tallest lighthouse, open for climbing 228 steps, with views of the ocean (duh) and city to the south. Staff is exceedingly friendly and knowledgeable about AC history. Nice gift shop as well to support the history museum. 

### Noyes Art Garage (Free, paid parking), 2300 Fairmount Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

An extension of the Noyes Art Museum (Hammonton) into Stockton University’s sphere, this gallery is a collection of exhibition booths and rooms that rotate frequently, while still presenting mostly local artists. Don’t miss the African American Heritage Museum of South Jersey, which is full of Black AC History. 

### Lucy the Elephant (Free), 9200 Atlantic Ave, Margate City, NJ

America’s oldest “roadside” attraction, built in 1881, is this recently restored six-story elephant on the beach! Totally kooky, Lucy has been drawing visitors since before the mass adoption of the automobile via train. Lucy’s multi-million dollar restoration was just completed, with a public unveiling in December 2022. (Ventura’s Greenhouse is across the street for affordable food and drinks.) 

### Edwin B. Forsythe Wildlife Refuge ($4/vehicle), 800 Great Creek Rd Oceanville, NJ

A world-class wildlife refuge with magical views of NJ’s unique wetlands and the AC skyline. Forsythe is a must for naturalists, featuring walking paths and platforms, as well as an 8-mile car loop that takes 30-60 minutes to drive (contingent on how frequently you stop for birds). Depending on the season, one can find massive populations of migratory ducks or gulls, while ospreys, bald eagles, and herons can be found year-round. 

### Ventnor Fishing Pier (free), S. Cambridge & the Boardwalk, Ventnor City, NJ

Walk out on the water at the only public fishing pier on the island. This spot attracts a great mix of fisherman of all types, and other locals getting their steps in. Great spot for the photographers among us. 

## BARS & PUBS

### Irish Pub and Inn ($-$$), 164 St. James Place, Atlantic City, NJ

What can I say about the Irish Pub?! Century old institution in Atlantic City that served as the exterior building model for the red hotel pieces in Monopoly. The Pub is a truly unique experience and place, featuring classic memorabilia, quality Guinness pours, and a gift shop that will send you time traveling. Open 24/7, with a kitchen that has sparse but quality options (corned beef sandwich, and top notch fish and chips) open until 3am. **\*Cash Only\***

### Wonder Bar ($-$$), 3701 Sunset Ave, Atlantic City, NJ

Best wings in AC, this unassuming sports bar is on the south end of town, situated right on the inlet with waterfront views. Good spot to hang out during a sporting event, but also fine for some wings to dine-in or take home. 

Many, many others, some fun ones include: 

Tony's Baltimore, Proud Mary's, Margaritaville, Little Water Distillery, Tennessee Ave Beer Hall, Ventura’s Greenhouse, Robert’s Place. 

Check the listings at **Anchor Rock Club** for musical performances.
