"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?" In 2021 I signed up for my 777th lay on the Pequod with a pandemic book club as we awaited our initial vaccines and dreamt of the watery world. These are the resulting discussion questions and agendas.

As we are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among lay readers as a rather purplish poetical and daunting pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye fellow shipmates, of the misunderstanding hereby done to us readers of "The Whale"....

### PROMPTS TO CONSIDER AND DISCUSS:

(Questions below adapted from ReadMoby.com)

How do you describe Ishmael's tone of voice in the first chapter? Does he sound confident, worried, fearful, boastful? What seems to be his philosophy of life as he travels to New Bedford to ship out?

What does Herman (Ishmael) Melville \[H.I.M.] say about the differences between landsmen and seamen? How does this relate to story structure?

Taking special note of the chapters 8-9 The Pulpit and The Sermon. What is the message in Brother Maple's sermon?

What is H.I.M's attitude toward religion and spirituality? Is there a distinction between them? What conclusion(s) has he drawn about the ideals of the Noble Savage and Christianity? What about Queequeg's faith and spiritual beliefs? What about the Quakers (Peleg and Bildad)?

Does H.I.M. seem to believe in Free Will, Fate, or a combination of the two, such as Machiavelli supports in the closing chapter of The Prince?

Note Melville's purpose of **Chapter 24: The Advocate**. Whaling is an important undertaking, of great significance, but little general recognition. Notice his obvious passion for the subject. What modern industries have similar parallels to 19th century whaling?

**The chapters 26-29** in this section review the command levels on board the ship. What do we know about the Pequod's mates and harpooners? What of Starbuck? Stubb and Flask are, perhaps, one-dimensional while still symbolizing belief systems; what are their attitudes towards work, life, and fate? 

While we hear from Peleg, Bildad, Elijah, and others about Ahab, his reveal is long coming. What do we know about Ahab's personality and character, and what do we learn about his inner conflict(s) in Chapter 30: The Pipe? 

**Chapter 32:** **Cetology** is a famous stumbling block for readers. What does this work of literary naturalism (naturalist literature?) add to the novel and reader's experience? What remains difficult to grasp in this chapter?

***BONUS***: Do you have any favorite passages or chapters to share? 

**BONUS**: For readers who have completed The Quarter-Deck, Hark!, The Chart, and First Lowering ... What do we know about the Pequod and her crew as we sight our first leviathan?



### QUOTES OF NOTE:

#### Chapter 1 The Loomings 

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish, Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. ...and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.

#### Chapter 7 The Chapel 

...how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city. All these things are not without their meanings. But Faith like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope. 

Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance...Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body who will take it I say, it is not me. 

#### Chapter 8 The Pulpit 

...for the pulpit is ever this earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world. 

#### Chapter 9 The Sermon 

...if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists. 

#### Chapter 13 Wheelbarrow 

Queequeg: It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians.

#### Chapter 16 The Ship 

For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. 

He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab.... 

...Ahab has his humanities. 

#### Chapter 17 The Ramadan 

...Heaven have mercy on us all--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending. 

#### Chapter 19 The Prophet

Elijah: "A soul's a sort of fifth wheel to a wagon."

#### Chapter 20 All Astir 

...when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. 

#### Chapter 23 The Lee Shore 

...all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea.... 

#### Chapter 24 The Advocate 

For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God? 

#### Chapter 26 Knights and Squires 

...an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward. 

Starbuck: "I will have no man in my boat who is not afraid of the whale." 

#### Chapter 28 Ahab 

...moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe. 

#### Chapter 29 Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb 

Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with aught that looks like death.

#### Chapter 32 Cetology

...But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans...
