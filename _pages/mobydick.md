"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship yet?" In 2021 I signed up for my 777th lay on the Pequod with a pandemic book club as we awaited our initial vaccines and dreamt of the watery world. These are the resulting discussion questions and agendas.

## Part I: 1-Loomings through 32-Cetology 

*As we are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among lay readers as a rather purplish poetical and daunting pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye fellow shipmates, of the misunderstanding hereby done to us readers of "The Whale"....*

### PROMPTS TO CONSIDER AND DISCUSS:

(Questions below adapted from ReadMoby.com)

How do you describe Ishmael's tone of voice in the first chapter? Does he sound confident, worried, fearful, boastful? What seems to be his philosophy of life as he travels to New Bedford to ship out?

What does Herman (Ishmael) Melville \[H.I.M.] say about the differences between landsmen and seamen? How does this relate to story structure?

Taking special note of the chapters 8-9 The Pulpit and The Sermon. What is the message in Brother Maple's sermon?

What is H.I.M's attitude toward religion and spirituality? Is there a distinction between them? What conclusion(s) has he drawn about the ideals of the Noble Savage and Christianity? What about Queequeg's faith and spiritual beliefs? What about the Quakers (Peleg and Bildad)?

Does H.I.M. seem to believe in Free Will, Fate, or a combination of the two, such as Machiavelli supports in the closing chapter of The Prince?

Note Melville's purpose of **Chapter 24: The Advocate**. Whaling is an important undertaking, of great significance, but little general recognition. Notice his obvious passion for the subject. What modern industries have similar parallels to 19th century whaling?

**The chapters 26-29** in this section review the command levels on board the ship. What do we know about the Pequod's mates and harpooners? What of Starbuck? Stubb and Flask are, perhaps, one-dimensional while still symbolizing belief systems; what are their attitudes towards work, life, and fate? 

While we hear from Peleg, Bildad, Elijah, and others about Ahab, his reveal is long coming. What do we know about Ahab's personality and character, and what do we learn about his inner conflict(s) in Chapter 30: The Pipe? 

**Chapter 32:** **Cetology** is a famous stumbling block for readers. What does this work of literary naturalism (naturalist literature?) add to the novel and reader's experience? What remains difficult to grasp in this chapter?

***BONUS***: Do you have any favorite passages or chapters to share? 

**BONUS**: For readers who have completed The Quarter-Deck, Hark!, The Chart, and First Lowering ... What do we know about the Pequod and her crew as we sight our first leviathan?

### QUOTES OF NOTE:

#### Chapter 1 The Loomings

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish, Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. ...and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.

#### Chapter 7 The Chapel

...how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city. All these things are not without their meanings. But Faith like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope. 

Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance...Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body who will take it I say, it is not me. 

#### Chapter 8 The Pulpit

...for the pulpit is ever this earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world. 

#### Chapter 9 The Sermon

...if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists. 

#### Chapter 13 Wheelbarrow

Queequeg: It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians.

#### Chapter 16 The Ship

For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. 

He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab.... 

...Ahab has his humanities. 

#### Chapter 17 The Ramadan

...Heaven have mercy on us all--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending. 

#### Chapter 19 The Prophet

Elijah: "A soul's a sort of fifth wheel to a wagon."

#### Chapter 20 All Astir

...when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. 

#### Chapter 23 The Lee Shore

...all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea.... 

#### Chapter 24 The Advocate

For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God? 

#### Chapter 26 Knights and Squires

...an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward. 

Starbuck: "I will have no man in my boat who is not afraid of the whale." 

#### Chapter 28 Ahab

...moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe. 

#### Chapter 29 Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb

Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with aught that looks like death.

#### Chapter 32 Cetology

...But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans...

Part II: 33-xx through 70-zz

*When you finish Chapter Seventy, you are halfway through our journey. Are you a survivor, or will you jump ship? Chop wood. Carry water. Guard the watch. Paddle swiftly. Cook well the whale steak. Avoid slippery surfaces. Try and sleep soundly between the rapping of sharktails on the hull… and watch out for the wrath of superiors...* 

PROMPTS TO CONSIDER AND DISCUSS:

Chapters 33-40 assume a dramatic structure and deepen our understanding of the Pequod’s crew and structure by revealing chorus characters (and song). What do we learn about the ship, her crew, and their opinions of Ahab’s mission? This string of chapters concludes with an “I, Ishmael…”.  How do varying structures enhance the book by serving plot, theme, and symbolism? 

Ch 46: Surmises, gives deeper insight into Ahab's character and into his thinking processes. Note Ahab's acknowledgement that he has, indeed, overstepped the boundaries of even a captain. What does he know the crew can legally do about the hunt for Moby if he does not take care to prevent it? What does he intend to do?

Ch 41: Moby-Dick is an essay within the book, encapsulating its themes and serving as a keystone for it’s structure.  

Take note of Ishmael's observation of concrete objects or sightings and his elevation of them. He will increasingly elevate concrete scenes and events. For instance, Ch 51: The Spirit-Spout, describes a real sighting that is associated with Moby Dick, then associates it with the mysteriousness of Life. In Ch 58: Brit, he realistically describes a peaceful scene of Right Whales scooping up Brit, then elevates that scene to the "full awfulness of the sea."



Remember, Ishmael is a Romantic, a symbolist. He is no longer a landsman, who concentrates only on the "real." Reality for a Romantic is but a mask or symbol of what lies beyond. For example, the surface of the sea itself is a "reality"; what lies hidden beneath is "truth." Reality is paradoxical.

Ch 55: Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales is richly referential, in the 19th-century literary tradition; here is a great resource blog containing all images referenced. "The great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last." The best way to see a whale, he concludes, is to go whaling. (Perhaps also the only way to observe “Brit” or “Squid”. How do these other species factor into our tail, er, tale?)

Consider Ch 66: Shark Massacre. This short chapter describes the killing of sharks in high detail. But take note of the last paragraph. It gives insight into Queequeq's philosophy. What is it?

Ch 68: The Blanket describes the skin and blubber of the whale in great detail. Note the last paragraph--a direct elevation and application to humans. Ishmael learns from Nature:....Oh, man! admire and model thyself after the whale! Do thou too remain warm among ice.... Here are direct lessons, and Ishmael wants us to know them. This is Romanticism: We observe Nature and we learn about ourselves.

More broadly, what does this section of the book establish about the capital enterprise of whaling? 

Ahab’s soliloquy in Ch 70: The Sphynx encapsulates the spiritual majesty and mystery of the whale. What does this (incredibly poetic passage) reveal about Ahab (remember, he’s been to colleges…) and man’s views on whales? How does this relate to Brother Mapple’s sermon and to the depictions of whales included in this section? 

BONUS: Ch 73: Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk Over Him we begin to learn of dissension in the ranks. What do the mates think of Ahab’s phantoms? 

BONUS: Ch 78: Cistern and Buckets we witness Tashtego’s death/rebirth and some quintessential Queequeg Chadness. 



QUOTES OF NOTE:



Chapter 33: The Speksynder 

(note: Speksynder, Dutch origin, means literally “fat-cutter” or “chief harpooner”)

For be a man's intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments.... Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air! 



Chapter 34: The Cabin 

Table ...Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom! 



Chapter 35: The Masthead 

... lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space; like Cranmer's sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over. There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists! 



Chapter 36: The Quarter-Deck 

"D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the chick that's in him pecks the shell. T'will soon be out." "Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "that simply smote thee from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous." All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks...If a man will strike, strike through the mask! (Ahab). Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me (Ahab). Who's over me? Truth hath no confines (Ahab). 



Chapter 37: Sunset 

Ahab: Gifted with high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! 

Ahab: Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match itself must needs be wasting! 

Ahab: What I've dared, I've willed; and what I've willed, I'll do! 



Chapter 38: Dusk 

Starbuck: Oh, life! 'tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge, -as wild, untutored things are forced to feed-Oh, life! 'tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee!



Chapter 39: First Night-Watch 

Stubb: HA! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!--I've been thinking over it ever since, and that ha, HA's the final consequence. Why so? Because a laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all that's queer; and come what will, one comfort's always left--that unfailing comfort is, it's all predestinated. 



Stubb: I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing.



Chapter 40: Midnight, Forecastle 

Pip: Oh, thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear! 



Chapter 41: Moby Dick 

I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's quenchless feud seemed mine. ...immortality is but ubiquity in time... ...all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill. 



Chapter 42: The Whiteness of the Whale 

Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright. ...all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within... 



(467 words)

“Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognized a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants” above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial color the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble things- the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.”





Chapter 44: The Chart 

God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very creature he creates. 



Chapter 49: The Hyena 

There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own. 



Chapter 53: The Albatross 

But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed. 



Chapter 54: The Town Ho's Story 

Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours-- watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. 



Chapter 59: Brit 

...as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst never return! 

### Chapter 61: The Line

All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. 

### Chapter 63: The Dart 

To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of toil. 

### Chapter 64: Stubb’s Supper

Once more the sermon proceeded.

“Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for; dat is natur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why den you be angel; for all angel is not’ing more dan de shark well goberned. Now, look here, bred’ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a helping yourselbs from dat whale. Don’t be tearin’ de blubber out your neighbour’s mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale belong to some one else. I know some o’ you has berry brig mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can’t get into de scrouge to help demselves.”

“Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”

### Chapter 66: Shark Massacre

“Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage, agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.”

### Chapter 68: The Blanket 

Oh, man! admire and model thyself after the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of thine own. 

### Chapter 70: The Sphynx 

It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx’s in the desert. “Speak, thou vast and venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has moved amid this world’s foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor’s side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou saw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw’st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!”
