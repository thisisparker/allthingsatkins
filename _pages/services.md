* Strategic Communications Consultation
  
  Every communications campaign requires a clear and concise understanding of who, what, when, where, why and how. Identifying your target audience, how to reach them, and what actions you wish for them to take are foundational steps to ensuring a campaign’s ultimate success. Atkins can provide a facilitated discussion leading to campaign strategy development to ensure your effort gets the eyeballs it deserves. A strategic consultation is a recommended step before engaging any other services, with a communications plan produced and returned to clients after an initial discussion.
  
* Earned Media Outreach
  
  Talking to the press can be intimidating! Drafting a proper press release, advisory, or statement and circulating in advance or after your big event is crucial to earning media attention and expanding your reach. Atkins can draft your press release and statement, work with your organization to deliver it to the proper media outlets, and support subsequent follow ups from reporters and news producers.
  
* Multimedia Production
  
  Today’s media landscape requires all of us to embrace multimedia as an essential tool in storytelling and energizing your supporters. While examining what media production is right for you, Atkins leverages years of experience to carry a project through pre-production, filming, editing and post production to deliver high-quality digital content that showcases your cause or characters to attract an online audience.
  
* Copywriting
  
  Elevate your message with words that matter. As an experienced copywriter, I craft engaging emails, dynamic marketing materials, impactful press releases, and more. From interviews to blogs and op-eds, let me tell your story and captivate your audience with words that resonate.
  
* Copyediting
  
  Ensure precision and clarity in your content. With expertise in editing email campaigns, marketing collateral, press releases, blogs, and op-eds, I refine your message for maximum impact. Additionally, my skills extend to technical manuals, planning guides, reports, white papers, and more, guaranteeing polished and professional communication.
  
* Digital Marketing Strategy
  
  Once you’ve earned media attention or finished your video production, it’s imperative that you properly leverage your existing online presence to build a loyal audience. Integrating press coverage and multimedia content into social media and email campaigns will help you assemble and retain followers.
