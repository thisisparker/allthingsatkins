In my professional life I’ve worked for television and film productions for public broadcast, interviewing authors, artists, architects, active military personnel, congresspersons, historians, and indigenous tribal leaders along the way. I am currently the Communications Director for [New Jersey Future](https://www.njfuture.org/), a statewide policy nonprofit based in Trenton that advocates for equitable investment in water and transportation infrastructure, redevelopment, and a fair balance between development and preservation in the densest state in the U.S. 

I’ve worked political campaigns for local, state, and federal office, and volunteered for public interest endeavors, including the [Baseball Reliquary](https://baseballreliquary.org/) and [Cape May Bird Observatory](https://njaudubon.org/centers/cape-may-bird-observatory/) with elected board positions with [KPFK Los Angeles](https://www.kpfk.org/) and the [East Hollywood Neighborhood Council](https://www.easthollywood.net/). 

Prior to relocating to New Jersey in 2021, I served for four years as the Communications Director for Friends of the Los Angeles River, which organizes the largest urban river cleanup in the nation, and advocates for equitable access and a rewilded river in the heart of Los Angeles. 

I live in Atlantic City, NJ where my hobbies include bat detecting, bar hopping, and betting on the Birds. Contact me at <michael@allthingsatkins.com>.
