### **Humans make music. Musical increments are songs, which run for minutes. Sixty seconds make a minute, sixty minutes in an hour. Twenty-four hours in a day, seven days per week, four weeks a moon cycle.Twelve of those mark a year, one year in a calendar.**

## **Give us this day our daily song**
