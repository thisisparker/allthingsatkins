[The Dalliance Of The Eagles](https://allpoetry.com/The-Dalliance-Of-The-Eagles), Walt Whitman

SKIRTING the river road, (my forenoon walk, my rest,)

Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance of the eagles,

The rushing amorous contact high in space together,

The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, gyrating wheel,

Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass tight grappling,

In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight downward falling,

Till o'er the river pois'd, the twain yet one, a moment's lull,

A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, talons loosing,

Upward again on slow-firm pinions slanting, their separate diverse

        flight,

She hers, he his, pursuing.



The American Bald Eagle has made a heroic comeback! A flurry of feathered news lately centers on New Jersey, which just became the latest state to DELIST the Bald Eagle from the endangered species list in January 2025. Once there was only one nesting eagle pair in all of the Garden State; now it boasts over 300. On his way out the door, former President Biden also named the eagle as our national bird, which, as appropriately observed nearly everywhere, was surprising in itself that it took until our 248th year since the Declaration of Independence to make official. (Typical of our elected leaders, I might add....)

New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered in January, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence — and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago.

37 - Riverboy: “The Mask”, Lewis MacAdams

I built this river — 

not with my hands, 

but with my imagination. Now it’s 

Super Bowl Sunday, and the Eagles 

are underdogs to the Patriots; 

so practice the patience

that you learned from the sedge, 

unchanged for millenia 

because it made a deal 

with the wading birds 

to write their sacred names 

with cloud bursts on moving water. 

I built this river, now with my dreams

 but with my drama; 

though now I feel it ebbing, drying 

up and cracking like a mud man’s mask. 

I built this river with my karma, 

just so I would have a park bench to sit on 

when I had no 

other place to go.
