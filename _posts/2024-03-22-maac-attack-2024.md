Last week Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall played gracious host for the fifth consecutive year of the Mid Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) basketball championship tournament. For the uninitiated, the winner of this tournament earns an automatic bid to the “Big Dance”, the NCAA basketball tournament. Soon, interoffice bracket mavens and neophytes, fans of Men’s or Women’s basketball, and bettors looking for an edge will catch the madness. The MAAC conference championship is therefore a telling window into the bracket busters and undervalued underdogs. It seems nearly yearly a “mid major” conference team upsets a Final Four favorite to fit a glass slipper at the dance. This tournament is a pre-tremor for the following week. A place and moment in Atlantic City where you can get the jump.
