**Description**:
*Perchance to Dream: A Music Video Tribute to David Lynch* is a fifteen track video art experience that pays homage to the surreal and haunting world of David Lynch. Featuring three original edits from the *Twin Peaks* soundtrack, the piece drives at high speed on a lonesome highway into an atmospheric journey through memory, mystery, and romance. The original rearrangements of *Twin Peaks* intersperse Angelo Badalamenti’s music with fragmented transmissions from the “Diane Tapes”. Throughout, the meditation on Lynch’s cinematic eyes and ears pulses with dreamlike visuals that blur the line between past and present, reality and illusion.
